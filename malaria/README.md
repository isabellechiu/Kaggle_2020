# Malaria Parametric Classification

The parametric classification is carried out on a repository of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria Screener research activity. The images come from samples Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P. falciparum-infected and 50 healthy patients were collected and photographed at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh. 

Classification is done by extracting a feature from the sample using clustering by k-mean to identify the proportion of infected and uninfected area. This classification is carried out according to the imposed cost restrictions.
